               <h2>Early Life</h2>
               <p>Lionel Andrés Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a
                   steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop.
               </p>
                <p>
                    Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency as a
                    child. At age 13, he relocated to Spain to join Barcelona, who agreed to pay for his medical
                    treatment. After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his competitive
                    debut aged 17 in October 2004.
                </p>
                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>
                    On 24 June 2005, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player. It made
                    him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause
                    increased to €150 million. His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August, during the Joan
                    Gamper Trophy, Barcelona's pre-season competition. A starter for the first time, he gave a
                    well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In his first uninterrupted campaign, the 2008–09 season, he scored 38 goals in 51 games,
                    contributing alongside Eto'o and winger Thierry Henry to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a
                    record at the time for the club.
                </p>
                <p>During his first season under Barcelona's new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played
                    mainly on the right wing, like he had under Rijkaard, though this time as a false winger with the
                    freedom to cut inside and roam the centre. During the Clásico on 2 May 2009, however, he played for
                    the first time as a false nine, positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to
                    link up with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. He assisted with a chip his side's first goal and scored twice
                    to end the match in an emphatic 6–2 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's
                    Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.
                </p>

                <h2>Style of Play</h2>
                <p>
                    Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him
                    greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles;
                    this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica ("The Atomic Flea").
                    Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined
                    with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges
                    from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with
                    playacting. His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration
                    while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed. His
                    former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, "Messi is the only player that runs faster with
                    the ball than he does without it." Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot
                    since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot,
                    he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes
                    and assists.
